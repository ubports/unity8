### How to install

The latest development preview of Unity8 for desktop can be installed on Ubuntu 16.04 (xenial) and 18.04 (bionic) as follows:

1. Run the install script
```
bash <(wget -qO- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ubports/unity8-desktop-install-tools/master/install.sh)
```
2. Reboot, select "unity8" at the login prompt, and enjoy :)


**NOTE:**  The above installation instructions currently only work on Ubuntu 16.04 (xenial) and 18.04 (bionic). Please be aware that the script will install the latest *development preview* of Unity8 for desktop.  ***Expect bugs!***  Only install this preview if you understand the risks and are willing/able to fix your system if the preview breaks anything.  You are advised *not* to install this preview onto a production system.

See [CODING](CODING) for build instructions.


### Where to report issues

Issues related to the version of Unity8 for desktop (the latest development preview) installed using the above instructions should be reported on the [Unity8 issue tracker](https://github.com/ubports/unity8/issues) in *this* repository.

Note that issues related to the version of Unity8 that currently runs on Ubuntu Touch devices should *NOT* be reported in this repository, but instead should be reported on the [Ubuntu Touch issue tracker](https://github.com/ubports/ubuntu-touch/issues). This will change once Ubuntu Touch moves to the latest version of Unity8.
