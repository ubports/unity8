  [ Nick Dedekind ]
  * Added Panel/VisibleIndicatorsModel for use with both indicator row &
    menuContent. This removes the need to hide indicators in the row and
    map inicator indexes between row & content. Fixes the indicator
    highlight line offset not bound by listView position.
  * Ported indicators to using ubuntu-settings-components

  [ Albert Astals ]
  * Prepend /sbin/ to initctl calls My phablet user does not have /sbin/
    in path and thus this calls fail
  * Call updateDelegateCreationRange when it's needed It depends on
    other variables than the ones we were using to call it, so need to
    call it if these change too Device manual test, go to apps scope,
    scroll down so that only part of the installed apps collapsed
    category is shown, expand it, see how previously some icons were not
    painted and now they are

  [ Mirco Müller ]
  * Fixed the failure of notification autopilot-test
    test_sd_incoming_call.

  [ Andrea Cimitan ]
  * Add AP test for policykit/network manager, which was causing issues
    with nested mir

  [ CI bot ]
  * Resync trunk

  [ Michał Karnicki ]
  * Don't display artShape when artImage source not set.
  * Fix FilterGrid rendering issues.

unity8 (7.84+14.04.20140128-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  [ Michal Hruby ]
  * Added unity-scope-tool, which will help when developing scopes.

  [ Michał Sawicz ]
  * Added unity-scope-tool, which will help when developing scopes.
  * Use full DashContent, not just GenericScopeView in ScopeTool.qml.
  * Bring Card and CardHeader over from new-scopes.
  * Work around bug #1268578. (LP: #1268578)
  * Drop unnecessary version dependencies.
  * Return null instead of undefined from findChild and
    findInvisibleChild.
  * Fix CardHeader and Card heights (empty Label does have non-zero
    height apparently). Also improve test robustness and reduce future
    diffs.

  [ Albert Astals ]
  * Do not assert if the item we are removing was not created yet
    (because e.g. it's not in the viewport).
  * Position correctly the pointer of the search history box .
  * Make test_filter_expand_expand less unstable in CI VMs Make sure
    header0 is the header0 we want to click On the CI VM stuff is a bit
    slower than on real hw and we were clicking in the wrong place.
  * Add TabBar to the Dash header navigation Changes this comes with: *
    DashBar at the bottom is gone * PageHeader doesn't have a Label
    anymore, it has the childItem property where you add which thing it
    has to contain * New: PageHeaderLabel mimics the old behaviour of
    PageHeader * The header of the LVWPH of GenericScopeView is now fake
    and only used for positioning. There is a single global floating
    header in DashContent (which is a PageHeader with a TabBar as
    childItem) * The GenericScopeView previewLoader and OpenEffect have
    been also moved to the DashContent so that the openEffect includes
    the floating header in the "animation" .
  * Introduce the HorizontalJournal.
  * If there are no items m_firstVisibleIndex has to be -1 .
  * Add some more documentation about tests to the CODING file.
  * Fixes to the journal cmake tests code * Output to the correct
    filename for the test * Don't output stuff from the tryXYZ targets.
  * Adapt to findChild return value changes .
  * Organic Grid for the Dash View.
  * Misc journal fixes Don't init *modelIndex to INT_MAX Makes no sense
    since we're not doing any qMin and the calling function also accepts
    any index >= 0 as valid so in some cases it may end up wanting to
    create an index that doesn't exist Don't refill if height() < 0,
    that gives bad ranges for from/to and the code gets confused .

  [ Michał Karnicki ]
  * Fix grid view column count.
  * Add test for minimum number of items in a carousel.

  [ Allan LeSage ]
  * Add stubs for indicators autopilot tests.

  [ Andrea Cimitan ]
  * Avoid input falling through notifications onto surfaces below, thus
    fixing LP: #1257312. (LP: #1257312)

  [ Leo Arias ]
  * Close the Touch devices after the tests. (LP: #1267600)
  * Added methods to scroll to other scopes on autopilot tests.
  * Added autopilot helpers for the app scope and the app preview.

    #1269114)
  * On autopilot helpers, wait for the scope category to appear.

  [ Nick Dedekind ]
  * Visual updates for indicator panel highlight and opening opacity.
  * Added inidcator tests for page & item factories.
  * Fixes visible indicator misalignment in indicator items/menus
    (lp#1264678). (LP: #1264678)

  [ Mirco Müller ]
  * Fixed the failure of notification autopilot-test
    test_sd_incoming_call.

  [ Michael Zanetti ]
  * clean up fullscreen notifications code.
  * import qml files into cmake, drop qmlproject.
  * also add qml files in tests directory.
  * Added autopilot helpers for the app scope and the app preview.
    Install the fake scopes in order to use them on the tests. (LP:
    #1269114)

  [ Michael Terry ]
  * Fix failure to build when using the ./build script with ninja-build
    installed. (LP: #1268525)
  * Point DBus-activated processes at unity8's MIR_SOCKET rather than
    the system socket.

  [ Daniel d'Andrada ]
  * DragHandle: Never restart hinting animation while still pressed (LP:
    #1269022)

  [ Bill Filler ]
  * fix for lp:1259294, turn off auto capitalization for wifi password
    field. (LP: #1259294)
  * disable predictive text in Dash search field as it interferes with
    built-in search (LP: #1273643)

    files around to be where they fit, also adapt everything else to
    match.

  [ Michael Hall ]
  * Update CODING to reflect the fact that only 14.04 is supported
    currently.

  [ Christopher Lee ]
  * Make use of helpers in all tests. (LP: #1260860). (LP: #1260860)

  [ Nic ]
  * Added kill time 30 to unity8 override. Added install path. (LP:
    #1260379)

    Utils plugin.

  [ Mirco Müller ]
  * Support fullscreen for special-case extended snap-decision of the

  [ Michael Zanetti ]
  * Change the default behaviour of the Lockscreen to have a variable
    PIN length, requiring the user to confirm with OK.

  * Update CODING with instructions on how to run tests.

  [ Dimitri John Ledkov ]
  * Fix cross-compilation.

unity8 (7.84+14.04.20131212-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  [ Michał Sawicz ]
  * Add PyDev project files for autopilot tests. Also tweak .bzrignore
    to not ignore generic Eclipse project definitions.
  * Retry unlocking the greeter three times.
  * Reduce code duplication and clean up CMakeLists and includes in
    indicator tests.

  [ Nick Dedekind ]
  * Replaced indicator page dynamic menuSelected binding with Connection
    to listview selectedIndex property. (LP: #1243146)
  * Indicators close when menu items are activated. (LP: #1238182)
  * Fixed up connections for changes to model data. (LP: #1253810)

  [ Albert Astals ]
  * dashItemSelected -> showDashHome Because we are not using the index
    at all in the upper layers.
  * Fix filtering colllapsing/expanding again Also the delegate creation
    range stuff flows up->down not down->up so rearrange the bindings.

unity8 (7.84+14.04.20131206.1-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  [ Michal Hruby ]
  * Ensure DashContent's ListView's currentItem is set if the model is
    not empty.

  [ Michał Sawicz ]
  * Don't generate build-deps .deb twice and allow overriding
    QML2_IMPORT_PATH in ./run.

  [ Albert Astals ]
  * Remove unused Applications/ folder .
  * Implement an 'interface' for Dash Renderers.
  * Use deelistmodel's conversion method Instead of a copy of the code .
  * Remove icons we don't use .
  * Do not start apps or go to dash on demo If you are pulling the
    launcher out while in demo mode it doesn't make sense to let you
    start applications. Besides it locks you out because it starts the
    app and the demo is still not finished so you can't really use any
    of the edges to escape Bug #1233696. (LP: #1233696)
  * Add a test for the carousel showing the preview when being clicked .
  * Fix collapsing of categories not working and the
    expansion/collapsing animation +test.

  [ Timo Jyrinki ]
  * Depend on either Qt 5.2 or libqt5v8-5-private-dev.
  * qtdeclarative5-private-dev 5.0.2-6ubuntu5 now depends directly on Qt
    V8 private headers. The remaining "qtdeclarative5-private-dev"
    dependency is enough now both when compiling against 5.0.2 or 5.2.

  [ Pete Woods ]
  * Handle optional parameterized action properties. (LP: #1256258)

  [ Andrea Cimitan ]
  * Implement an 'interface' for Dash Renderers.

  [ Michael Zanetti ]
  * Added music preview.
  * rename some parameters from desktopFile to appId as scopes are now
    changed to give us the appId.
  * unhardcode launcher's search paths for .desktop files.
  * Enable teasing of the phone greeter even though we have a
    lockscreen.
  * check if variant is valid to avoid asserting in debug mode when the
    connection to AccountsService doesn't work for some reason .

  [ Michael Terry ]
  * Add the DBus greeter API from the desktop greeter into the unity8
    greeter.

  [ Daniel d'Andrada ]
  * Dash: disable close mode when you click outside app thumbnails To
    leave the termination mode you can now just mouse/touch press
    anywhere outside the running applications' thumbnails The other way,
    which still works, is long-pressing a thumbnail once more. (LP:

unity8 (7.84+14.04.20131128.2-0ubuntu1) trusty; urgency=low

  [ Michal Hruby ]
  * Depend on the separate scopes plugin
  * Move the BottomBar* DBus communicator to the Utils plugin.

  [ Michał Sawicz ]
  * Wait for DashHome to be available in tst_Shell. (LP: #1254898)
  * Use plugindir from unity-shell-api.pc.
  * Expect stop in upstart job and raise in case of surfaceflinger. (LP:
    #1239876)

  [ Albert Astals ]
  * Fix time test in Qt 5.2 Make factors an array instead of a
    object/dict Objects/dicts are unordered by definition, it happened
    that Qt 5.0 gave them in the orrder we wanted, but with Qt 5.2 is
    failing, and we don't even need the "key", so array works as well
    :).
  * Test that the dash hswipe is disabled while the inner stuff is
    moving .
  * Skip restMaximizeVisibleAreaMoveUpAndShowHeader, it's causing too
    many failed runs And we are confident it's failing because of the
    suboptimal scenegraph run in 5.0.x.
  * Make Dash::test_show_scope_on_load more robust If we are testing
    showScopeOnLoaded make sure we force a scope reload after we set it,
    otherwise it may just happen that the scope has already been loaded
    and the expectaction that we'll change the list to it is just wrong.
  * Dash renderer signals: No need to pass the model up and down Whoever
    is listening to the signal has access to the item that emits the
    signal and has the model right there accessible if needs it.
  * LVWPH: Fix header going bad when setContentHeight ends up moving the
    viewport How to reproduce the bug easily without the patch: * In the
    Dash Home, search for london * Scroll to the bottom * Start moving
    to the apps scope very slowly * At around 3/4 of the move you'll see
    the header in the home scope went to a bad position * Go back to the
    Dash Home. (LP: #1237942, #1246351)
  * Remove unused AppInfo and VideoInfo files .
  * Kill unused ApplicationsFilterGrid.qml .
  * Unify ScopeView and GenericScopeView .
  * Fix header getting lost as per bug 1245824. (LP: #1245824)
  * Remove unused Time.js and its test .
  * Do not include the QtQml megaheader Include only qqml.h which is
    what we need in these files.
  * Don't do stuff if our parent context is gone We'll be gone soon too
    (and crash probably) so don't do anything. This looks a bit like a
    workaround, wait for 5.2 better painting/dispatching loop to see if
    this is not needed anymore, we find a better way to do it, or we
    decide this is fine.

  [ Lars Uebernickel ]
  * Allow setting different indicator positions for different profiles.

  [ Mirco Müller ]
  * Added checkbox for toggling between echo-modes of password-
    entryfields in ext. snap-decisions.
  * Fixes bug #1200569. (LP: #1200569)

  [ Andrea Cimitan ]
  * Switch to application scope when a dash swipe is taking place and an
    app is on foreground. (LP: #1231996)
  * Shifts wallpaper rendering for greeter lockscreen to be inline with
    shell. (LP: #1231731)
  * Dinamically load the Carousel/Filtergrid with more than 6 items.
    (LP: #1226288, #1234105)
  * Removes Math.js and its usage. Use SDK ones.

  [ Gerry Boland ]
  * DragHandle: javascript argument name clashes with local variable.
    Yes it works, but is a little unsafe.

  [ Nick Dedekind ]
  * Added UnityMenuModel submenu row removal awareness in
    UnityMenuModelStack.
  * Round indicator widget icon/label width up to closest gu for
    alignment. (LP: #1236267)
  * Indicator re-select by dragging from top when fully opened. (LP:
    #1213164)
  * Fixed a race condition causing search history popup to show up when
    it shouldn't. (LP: #1249369)

  [ Christopher Lee ]
  * Unity8 tests now make use of the helper functions (added in the pre-
    req branch) so that the helper functions are tested as part of daily
    business.

  [ Daniel d'Andrada ]
  * Improve DirectionalDragArea Removed Rejected status, simplifying
    state machine. Added compositionTime property. Multi-finger
    scenarios are better handled now. Refactored TimeSource in
    Ubuntu.Gestures plugin. Added an easy way to debug
    DirectionalDragArea by having switchable debug prints. Updated tests
    to also simulate the passage of time. Use touch point scene
    coordinates for gesture recognition so that moving the.
    DirectionalDragArea (as in a hinting DragHandle) won't affect it.
    (LP: #1228336)
  * Add right-edge drag hinting to Greeter To match with the existing
    teasing animation when you tap on the right half of the Greeter.
    Also has the side benefit of making the code look a bit nicer.
  * Refactor Ubuntu.Gesture tests to share common logic Take the common
    part out of tst_DirectionalDragArea and put it into a separate base
    class, GestureTest, so that it can be shared with other, future,
    tests. In CMakeLists.txt, create a macro out of DirectionalDragArea
    build script to be used by future tests with similar requirements
    and structure. Also add the "m_" prefix to member variables.
  * Remove dead code from Utils plugin They are not being used anywhere.

  [ Michael Terry ]
  * Make EdgeDemoOverlay test more reliable by testing for what we
    really care about, not an indirect indicator of it. (LP: #1248232)
  * Explicitly set MIR_SOCKET for other upstart jobs, rather than
    relying on the default socket, since that won't work once we move to
    a nested Mir.

  [ Michael Zanetti ]
  * don't add margins to RunningApplicationTile's label. (LP: #1245482)
  * allow SIM PIN entry to have a variable pin length (by adding a done-
    button). (LP: #1240561)
  * fix launcher wording for pinning actions. (LP: #1240891)
  * fix preview background positioning don't explicitly take originY
    into account as it's already in there implicitly. make sure we don't
    split the openeffect in a place where it can be covered by the
    header.
  * fix album artwork containing / in the name. (LP: #1237829)
  * small launcher tweaks fix fakeDragItem's initial position to match
    with real item. remove UbuntuShape's border glow. .
  * drop all references to LighDM from the Lockscreen This should make
    it generic enough to allow reusing it for SIM PIN entry .

  [ Omer Akram ]
  * make the non working code in the screen unlocker helper work.

  [ Nicolas d'Offay ]
  * Pushed up the z order of the clock in GreeterContent. (LP: #1233146)
  * Search history is now persistent across all scopes and remains in
    QML. (LP: #1226221)

  * Fix bug when setting the same model twice to a QLimitProxyModelQML.
  * Add some const & Saves us some microseconds in copying stuff.

  [ Daniel d'Andrada ]
  * Make Greeter and Stage use the new DragHandle component. So they no
    longer use Revealers. Now a directional drag gesture is required to
    start the animation that brings back a "minimized" application when
    the dash is on foreground. Besides that, now they have the following
    feature:  - Action only completes succesfully if you drag through at
    least half the    screen width or if your swipe is fast enough. The
    shorter the swipe, the faster it has to be for the action to auto-
    complete.
  * DirectionalDragArea: add touchSceneX, touchSceneY, and sceneDistance
    properties.
  * DirectionalDragArea: emit draggingChanged() on direct recognition
    draggingChanged() should be emited when status change from
    WaitingForTouch directly to Recognized.
  * update CODING instructions for building & running.
  * DragHandle: add stretch and hintDisplacement properties.
  * DragHandle: fix hinting Revision 64 had a bad interaction with
    revision 66 (that added line was lost in the merge/rebase process).
    tst_DragHandle::hintingAnimation() points out the problem (fails on
    line 388).
  * Make Panel use DragHandles instead of a Revealer - A directional
    drag gesture is needed reveal the panel when fullscreen. - better
    logic for deciding when to auto-complete the show/hide animation -
    hinting animation to close the panel - Tapping on menu bar no longer
    opens nearest indicator menu - No closing with handle click.

  [ mhall119 ]

    WrongPasswordAnimation.
  * improve the bzr commit hook - don't run qmltests in here, it takes
    too long - don't abort commit on failed tests, its too annoying -
    instead, print a fat warning and backup the commit message to be
    reused after uncommitting and fixing the tests.
  * edge hinting tweaks - change edge hinting behavior to only happen on
    onPressed and immediately snap back - fix edge hinting to not happen
    if the Greeter is locked .

  [ Michael Terry ]
  * Fix "Tap to Unlock" text not appearing when in tablet greeter mode
    with only one user.
