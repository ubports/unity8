  * Proxy inactivity timeout values from gsettings into Unity.Screen
    (LP: #1230345)

  [ Gerry Boland ]
  * Cancel open PAM interactions on shutdown - fixes hang on logout on
    desktop (LP: #1353041)

  [ Diego Sarmentero ]
  * Show progress bar on payment button click The payment process has a
    small delay before the UI comes up which might cause confusion. Show
    a progress bar with unknown value to indicate activity. (LP:
    #1354139)

  [ Mirco Müller ]
  * Made notification qml-test pass again by using Component.onCompleted
    instead of onOpacityChanged for the time being.

  [ Michael Zanetti ]
  * Implement new lockscreen designs

  [ Michael Terry ]
  * Show the SIM unlock dialog immediately after booting, and enable its
    emergency call button.
  * Always keep indicator/launcher locked state in sync with whether the
    user is authenticated. (LP:# 1357230) (LP: #1357230)
  * Allow logging into a desktop or tablet session again, by properly
    dismissing old PAM conversations. (LP: #1350878) In a desktop or
    tablet, we were accidentally starting two PAM conversations in
    sequence on startup. Which is a small bug; it shouldn't normally be
    a problem, since each new PAM conversation should kill the old
    one.But the way we were killing the old one was subject to a thread
    race condition. See, a PAM conversation thread won't exit until all
    its prompts are answered. And what we do when we kill a PAM
    conversation is to answer all prompts with empty strings.But it's
    possible that when we want to kill a PAM conversation that it hasn't
    actually gotten to the point of prompting us yet. And when those
    prompts do come through, we were treating them as prompts for the
    new PAM conversation.So I've changed the PAM conversation logic to
    include a pam_handle and compare the handle with the current handle
    when being prompted. If it's an old handle, we just dismiss the
    prompt with an empty string response.Oh, and I fixed the bug that
    caused two prompts on startup in the first place. (But we still need
    the above logic anyway, for when you switch users quickly.) (LP:
    #1350878)

  [ Martin Pitt ]
  * Mark for using language packs.

    which lightdm backend to use. Stop letting a user that is
    immediately denied via PAM into the shell by fixing some assumptions
    that a user which was not prompted was successfully authenticated.
    This is not a common situation, you'd have to manually change your
    PAM config. Fix a small console warning .
  * Make wrong-password handling much nicer by showing a pretty spinner
    while we wait for PAM, by improving the prompt text to match
    designs, by forcing the user to wait five seconds after every five
    failed attemps, and by supporting (but not yet enabling) an opt-in

    categories is a header of height 0, this way everything works as it

    anymore, it has the childItem property where you add which thing it

    PageHeader * The header of the LVWPH of GenericScopeView is now fake
    and only used for positioning. There is a single global floating
    header in DashContent (which is a PageHeader with a TabBar as
    childItem) * The GenericScopeView previewLoader and OpenEffect have
    been also moved to the DashContent so that the openEffect includes

  * qtdeclarative5-private-dev 5.0.2-6ubuntu5 now depends directly on Qt
    V8 private headers. The remaining "qtdeclarative5-private-dev"
    dependency is enough now both when compiling against 5.0.2 or 5.2.

  [ Albert Astals ]
  * Fix time test in Qt 5.2 Make factors an array instead of a
    object/dict Objects/dicts are unordered by definition, it happened
    that Qt 5.0 gave them in the orrder we wanted, but with Qt 5.2 is
    failing, and we don't even need the "key", so array works as well
    :).
  * Test that the dash hswipe is disabled while the inner stuff is
    moving .
  * Skip restMaximizeVisibleAreaMoveUpAndShowHeader, it's causing too
    many failed runs And we are confident it's failing because of the
    suboptimal scenegraph run in 5.0.x.
  * Make Dash::test_show_scope_on_load more robust If we are testing
    showScopeOnLoaded make sure we force a scope reload after we set it,
    otherwise it may just happen that the scope has already been loaded
    and the expectaction that we'll change the list to it is just wrong.
  * Dash renderer signals: No need to pass the model up and down Whoever
    is listening to the signal has access to the item that emits the
    signal and has the model right there accessible if needs it.
  * LVWPH: Fix header going bad when setContentHeight ends up moving the
    viewport How to reproduce the bug easily without the patch: * In the
    Dash Home, search for london * Scroll to the bottom * Start moving
    to the apps scope very slowly * At around 3/4 of the move you'll see
    the header in the home scope went to a bad position * Go back to the
    Dash Home. (LP: #1237942, #1246351)
  * Remove unused AppInfo and VideoInfo files .
  * Kill unused ApplicationsFilterGrid.qml .
  * Unify ScopeView and GenericScopeView .
  * Fix header getting lost as per bug 1245824. (LP: #1245824)
  * Remove unused Time.js and its test .
  * Do not include the QtQml megaheader Include only qqml.h which is
    what we need in these files.
  * Don't do stuff if our parent context is gone We'll be gone soon too
    (and crash probably) so don't do anything. This looks a bit like a
    workaround, wait for 5.2 better painting/dispatching loop to see if
    this is not needed anymore, we find a better way to do it, or we
    decide this is fine.

  * Improve DirectionalDragArea Removed Rejected status, simplifying
    state machine. Added compositionTime property. Multi-finger
    scenarios are better handled now. Refactored TimeSource in
    Ubuntu.Gestures plugin. Added an easy way to debug
    DirectionalDragArea by having switchable debug prints. Updated tests
    to also simulate the passage of time. Use touch point scene
    coordinates for gesture recognition so that moving the.
    DirectionalDragArea (as in a hinting DragHandle) won't affect it.
    (LP: #1228336)
  * Add right-edge drag hinting to Greeter To match with the existing
    teasing animation when you tap on the right half of the Greeter.
    Also has the side benefit of making the code look a bit nicer.
  * Refactor Ubuntu.Gesture tests to share common logic Take the common
    part out of tst_DirectionalDragArea and put it into a separate base
    class, GestureTest, so that it can be shared with other, future,
    tests. In CMakeLists.txt, create a macro out of DirectionalDragArea
    build script to be used by future tests with similar requirements
    and structure. Also add the "m_" prefix to member variables.
  * Remove dead code from Utils plugin They are not being used anywhere.

  [ Michael Terry ]
  * Make EdgeDemoOverlay test more reliable by testing for what we
    really care about, not an indirect indicator of it. (LP: #1248232)
  * Explicitly set MIR_SOCKET for other upstart jobs, rather than
    relying on the default socket, since that won't work once we move to
    a nested Mir.

    start the animation that brings back a "minimized" application when
    the dash is on foreground. Besides that, now they have the following
    feature:  - Action only completes succesfully if you drag through at
    least half the    screen width or if your swipe is fast enough. The
    shorter the swipe, the faster it has to be for the action to auto-
    complete.
  * DirectionalDragArea: add touchSceneX, touchSceneY, and sceneDistance

  * Make Panel use DragHandles instead of a Revealer - A directional
    drag gesture is needed reveal the panel when fullscreen. - better
    logic for deciding when to auto-complete the show/hide animation -
    hinting animation to close the panel - Tapping on menu bar no longer
