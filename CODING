Building Unity 8
================

Only Ubuntu 14.04 (trusty) is supported as a developement environment.

download source
---------------
- create a parent folder to not pollute your setup. so that you can have different unity
  branches there (trunk, WIP etc)

  $ mkdir ~/unity8

- fetch Unity 8 source
  $ sudo apt-get install bzr
  $ bzr branch lp:unity8 ~/unity8/trunk
  $ cd ~/unity8/trunk

install dependencies
--------------------
If its your first time, install build dependencies

$ cd ~/unity8/trunk
$ ./build.sh --setup

  this will:
  - install the required dependencies to build, as well as run on the desktop
  - it should also install unity-scope-home and unity-lens-application which
    are technically "recommends", not strict dependencies

build Unity 8
-------------

$ cd ~/unity8/trunk
$ ./build.sh

You may also rebuild with the -c for clean, which just deletes the build
directory.


Running Unity 8 on your desktop
===============================

run the Unity 8 shell
---------------------
$ cd ~/unity8/trunk
$ ./run.sh

Options can be passed to test the lock screen
$ ./run.sh -p OR -k

-p is for pin lock, for which the default prompt answer is "1234"
-k is for keylock passphrase, for which the default prompt answer is "password"

Notes
-----
- to navigate, utilize the mouse left button as you would your finger
- a three point drag (for side stage operations) can be performed by using
  the Shift+Control+Alt (all together) keyboard modifiers while using the mouse.
- to get the translations work, currently you have to do make install to
  put the *.mo files into correct structure. We'll look for a better solution
  later.
  $ cd builddir; make install
- if you wish to populate contacts
  $ sudo apt-get install gir1.2-ebook-1.2
  $ manage-address-book.py create
  this will:
    - Create an EDS address book
    - Populate the address book with sample data


Running Unity 8 on devices
==========================
- Ubuntu Touch builds are currently only available in 14.04 flavour
- supported hardware should match one of those listed here
  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Devices#Running_fine
- follow the Ubuntu Touch install instructions for your chosen device
  https://wiki.ubuntu.com/Touch/Install
- make sure your device is connected to a network
- also make sure you have your SSH key in ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub (or install one
  on the device yourself)

$ cd ~/unity/trunk
$ ./run_on_device.sh --setup
  this will:
  - install your public SSH key on the device
  - install the needed dependencies

$ ./run_on_device.sh
  this will:
  - rsync the code to the device
  - build on the device
  - replace the running shell

Options can be passed to test the lock screen
$ ./run_on_device.sh -p OR -k

-p is for pin lock, for which the default prompt answer is "1234"
-k is for keylock passphrase, for which the default prompt answer is "password"

Notes
-----
- using adb over TCP has some advantages, Google will be of help here
  - NOTE: this is not yet available for flipped images
  - TL;DR: `adb tcpip 5555; adb connect $your_device_ip`
  - you can persist the above via `adb shell setprop persist.adb.tcp.port 5555`
  - it's unsafe - anyone can connect to your device
  - with TCP the Nexus 10 doesn't drop the adb connection when locking
    the screen
- exporting ANDROID_SERIAL=$your_device_serial or
  ANDROID_SERIAL=$your_device_ip:5555 will make adb not complain about
  multiple devices
- you can export TARGET_IP=$your_device_ip TARGET_SSH_PORT=22 for run_on_device.sh
  to not use adb forwarding - useful if you use multiple devices
- using Ninja (package ninja-build - run_on_device.sh -s installs this now)
  will improve build times (especially in the nothing-to-build case)


Coding guidelines
=================
The work-in-progress coding guidelines are available under:
https://launchpad.net/canonical-client-development-guidelines


Development Environment
=======================
QtCreator (available via the Software Center) is the best IDE to hack on
Unity 8.

If using VIM, make sure you install some syntax highlighting for QML, like
https://github.com/peterhoeg/vim-qml

Running tests
=============

Tests are run from the build directory (which will be ./builddir if you used
the ./build.sh script).

To run the tests that do not require any graphical capability and therefore
are pretty fast run:

$ make test

or, alternatively:

$ ctest

To run all graphical tests, which can take a couple of minutes:

$ make uitests

To run the tests for a single component/class:

$ make testComponentName

So, for the DragHandle component that would be:

$ make testDragHandle

To run the tests for a single component/class under gdb (so you can catch SEGFAULTS)

$ make gdbtestComponentName

To run a single test function of a single component/class:

$ make testComponentName FUNCTION="TestCaseName::functionName"

To run a test application that allow you to manually test or to simply try out
a given component:

$ make tryComponentName

So to try out, for instance, the DragHandle component, you would do:

$ make tryDragHandle

NB: Manual test or interation doesn't make sense for all components or classes,
particularly the non-graphical ones. In such cases no "tryFoo" make target is
provided.

Running autopilot tests
=======================

Autopilot tests are run from the build directory (which will be ./builddir if you used
the ./build.sh script).

$ make autopilot

If you want you can also run tests individually, for that you need to install first,
otherwise the tests will run on the system-installed version

$ make install

To see the list of existing autopilot tests you can do

$ PYTHONPATH=../tests/autopilot autopilot3 list unity8

And then run a single test with

$ PYTHONPATH=../tests/autopilot autopilot3 run unity8.some.very.long.test.name

or run them all with

$ PYTHONPATH=../tests/autopilot autopilot3 run unity8

Debugging techniques
====================

Unity8 heavily uses Qt and with that Qt debugging techniques mostly apply in the
same fashion. There are, however, some additional unity8-specific notes:

* Enable/disable Qt scenegraph visualizer on the fly:

  $ qdbus com.canonical.Unity8.Debugging /com/canonical/Unity8/Debugging SetSceneGraphVisualizer <mode>

  This is equivalent to exporting QSG_VISUALIZE=<mode> before running unity8, except it does it on the
  fly.

* Toggle slow animations on the fly:

  $ qdbus com.canonical.Unity8.Debugging /com/canonical/Unity8/Debugging SetSlowAnimations <true|false>

* Change logging filter rules on the fly:

  $ qdbus com.canonical.Unity8.Debugging /com/canonical/Unity8/Debugging SetLoggingFilterRules <filter>

  This is equivalent to exporting QT_LOGGING_RULES or defining them in QT_LOGGING_CONF, except it does
  it on the fly.
